According to what we have above, we should first arrange A, and then B and C. Imagine there are \"slots\" and we need to arrange tasks by putting them into \"slots\". Then A should be put into slot 0, 3, 6 since we need to have at least n = 2 other tasks between two A. After A put into slots, it looks like this:\n","\n","A ? ? A ? ? A\n","\"?\" is \"empty\" slots.\n","\n","Now we can use the same way to arrange B and C. The finished schedule should look like this:\n","\n","A B C A B # A\n","\"#\" is idle\n","\n","Now we have a way to arrange tasks. But the problem only asks for number of CPU intervals, so we don't need actually arrange them. Instead we only need to get the total idles we need and the answer to problem is just number of idles + number of tasks.\n","Same example: 3 A, 2 B, 1 C, n = 2. After arranging A, we have:\n","A ? ? A ? ? A\n","We can see that A separated slots into (count(A) - 1) = 2 parts, each part has length n. With the fact that A is the task with most frequency, it should need more idles than any other tasks. In this case if we can get how many idles we need to arrange A, we will also get number of idles needed to arrange all tasks. Calculating this is not hard, we first get number of parts separated by A: partCount = count(A) - 1; then we can know number of empty slots: emptySlots = partCount * n; we can also get how many tasks we have to put into those slots: availableTasks = tasks.length - count(A). Now if we have emptySlots > availableTasks which means we have not enough tasks available to fill all empty slots, we must fill them with idles. Thus we have idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks);\n","Almost done. One special case: what if there are more than one task with most frequency? OK, let's look at another example: 3 A 3 B 2 C 1 D, n = 3\n","Similarly we arrange A first:\n","A ? ? ? A ? ? ? A\n","Now it's time to arrange B, we find that we have to arrange B like this:\n","A B ? ? A B ? ? A B\n","we need to put every B right after each A. Let's look at this in another way, think of sequence \"A B\" as a special task \"X\", then we got:\n","X ? ? X ? ? X\n","Comparing to what we have after arranging A:\n","A ? ? ? A ? ? ? A\n","The only changes are length of each parts (from 3 to 2) and available tasks. By this we can get more general equations:\n","partCount = count(A) - 1\n","emptySlots = partCount * (n - (count of tasks with most frequency - 1))\n","availableTasks = tasks.length - count(A) * count of tasks with most frenquency\n","idles = max(0, emptySlots - availableTasks)\n","result = tasks.length + idles\n","\n","What if we have more than n tasks with most frequency and we got emptySlot negative? Like 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D, 3E, n = 2.
